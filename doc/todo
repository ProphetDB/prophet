- Replace this todo list with a svb database
- elegant support for large attachments

Bug tracker:

    subject
    status
    severity
    custom fields
    owner
    keywords/tags
    reported by
    
    attachments / patches
    
    milestones?
    custom fields with possible values - loaded from some other record/table
    
    comments
        seperate records referring to the ticket uuid
        

Done, I think.

- when committing any change:
    - record the original depot uuid and change sequence_no as revprops
    - record two merge tickets:
        - sequence_no from the source that gave it to us
        - sequence_no from the original recording source

- naive support for large attachments
- ability to pull non-conflicting updates from a remote db
- implement merge of conflicts with: "local always wins"
- record conflict resolution data 
- reuse conflict resolution data on repeated resolve
- ability to 'pull' conflicting updates from a remote db
- prompt for resolution of conflicts
- handle file_conflict

- test byzantine sync behaviour
- handle conflicting conflict resolutions
- base bug tracking schema
