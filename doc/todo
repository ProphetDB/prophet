Bug tracker:

    subject
    status
    severity
    custom fields
    owner
    keywords/tags
    reported by
    
    attachments / patches
    
    milestones?

        seperate records referring to the ticket uuid
        

Done, I think.

- when committing any change:
    - record the original depot uuid and change sequence_no as revprops
    - record two merge tickets:
        - sequence_no from the source that gave it to us
        - sequence_no from the original recording source

- naive support for large attachments
- ability to pull non-conflicting updates from a remote db
- implement merge of conflicts with: "local always wins"
- record conflict resolution data 
- reuse conflict resolution data on repeated resolve
- ability to 'pull' conflicting updates from a remote db
- prompt for resolution of conflicts
- handle file_conflict
