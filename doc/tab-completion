zsh:
    sudo ln -vis `pwd`/etc/prophet.zsh /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_prophet
    (tested on Mac OS X 10.6)

bash:
    symlink etc/prophet.bash to your bash_completion.d directory, if you're using macports this 
    will be /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d
    On a linux platform, this is likely to be /etc/bash_completion.d
