=head2 Registering argument translations

This is the Prophet CLI's way of supporting short forms for arguments,
e.g. you want to let '-v' be able to used for the same purpose as
'--verbose' without dirtying your code checking both or manually
setting them if they exist. We want it to be as easy as possible
to have short commands.

To use, have your command subclass do:

    sub ARG_TRANSLATIONS { shift->SUPER::ARG_TRANSLATIONS(),  f => 'file' };

You can register as many translations at a time as you want.
The arguments will be translated when the command object is
instantiated. If an arg already exists in the arg translation
table, it is overwritten with the new value.

=cut

    my $self = shift;
    my %translations = $self->ARG_TRANSLATIONS;

    for my $arg (keys %translations) {
        $self->set_arg($translations{$arg}, $self->arg($arg))
            if $self->has_arg($arg);
    }
}

=head2 require_uuid

Checks to make sure the uuid attribute is set. Prints an error and dies
with the command's usage string if it is not set.

=head2 edit_hash hash => hashref, ordering => arrayref

Filters the hash through the user's C<$EDITOR> using L<Proc::InvokeEditor>.

No validation is done on the input or output.

If the optional ordering argument is specified, hash keys will be presented
in that order (with unspecified elements following) for edit.

If the record class for the current type defines a C<immutable_props>
routine, those props will not be presented for editing.

False values are not returned unless a prop is removed from the output.

=head2 edit_props arg => str, defaults => hashref, ordering => arrayref

Returns a hashref of the command's props mixed in with any default props.
If the "arg" argument is specified, (default "edit", use C<undef> if you only
want default arguments), then L</edit_hash> is invoked on the property list.

If the C<ordering> argument is specified, properties will be presented in that
order (with unspecified props following) if filtered through L</edit_hash>.
